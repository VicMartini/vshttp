# vshttp

A very simple HTTP server written in C++.

**WARNING:** In the unlikely case that you are considering using this in production, please don't. I'm writing this mainly to learn C++ and it's absolutely not production ready.

## Build

make
```

## Run

make run
```

## Releases

In the releses section you can find a fat binary for arm64/x86_64.
